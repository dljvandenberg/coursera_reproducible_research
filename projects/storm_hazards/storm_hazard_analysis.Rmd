# Synopsis

We performed an exploratory analysis of storm hazard data from the [data source...] in order to address the following questions: Across the United States, a) which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health in terms of fatalities and injuries, and b) which types of events have the greatest economic consequences in terms of property and crop damage? We looked at absolute effects summed per event type across all of the United States in [time period .. to ..].
[results..] Determined the top 10 event categories measured in terms of fatalities, injuries, property damage, crop damage
[discussion/in-depth] Investigate average/median damage per event type and its variability (boxplot!). Investigate number of events withing event types (boxplot per year -> shows variability)
