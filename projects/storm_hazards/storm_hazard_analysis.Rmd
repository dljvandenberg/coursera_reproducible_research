<!--
TODO: Your document should have a title that briefly summarizes your data analysis
-->


# Synopsis

<!--
TODO: There should be a synopsis which describes and summarizes your analysis in at most 10 complete sentences.
-->

Questions:

1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?


# Data Processing

<!--
TODO: Your analysis must start from the raw CSV file containing the data. You cannot do any preprocessing outside the document.
TODO_optional: cache = TRUE
-->

..

```{r}
# Retrieve and read data
if(!file.exists("stormdata.csv.bz2")){
    download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2", "stormdata.csv.bz2", method="curl")
}
df.stormdata <- read.csv("stormdata.csv.bz2")
```


# Results

..

<!--
* You may have other sections in your analysis, but Data Processing and Results are required.
* The analysis document must have at least one figure containing a plot.
* Your analyis must have no more than three figures. Figures may have multiple plots in them (i.e. panel plots), but there cannot be more than three figures total.
* You must show all your code for the work in your analysis document. This may make the document a bit verbose, but that is okay. In general, you should ensure that echo = TRUE for every code chunk (this is the default setting in knitr).
